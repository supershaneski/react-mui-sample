react-mui-sample
================

The main goal of this exercise is to get acquainted using [MUI](https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/), a React UI framework.


I have been using Material-UI since v4 but have not yet used v5 which has some breaking changes and new ways of doing things.


So I will make a simple responsive application and see for myself. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Installation

Clone the project and to install dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

Then to run the project:

```
npm start
